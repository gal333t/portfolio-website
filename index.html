        <p>Welcome to my coding project showcase! My name is Galit, and for the last five years, I have been immersed in
            the fascinating world of television scheduling. With a strong background in administrative work,
            I've gained valuable experience and honed my organizational skills in this fast-paced industry. However, my
            journey has taken an exciting turn as I've delved into the captivating realm of coding.</p>
        <p>Driven by a desire for more engaging and dynamic work, I've eagerly embraced the world of programming.
            Equipped with a diverse skill set that includes <em>Javascript, HTML, CSS, ExpressJS, NodeJs, Postgres, and
                MongoDB</em>, I've honed my abilities to bring my ideas to life through code. With each project, I
            strive to
            combine my past experiences in television with my newfound coding skills, creating innovative solutions that
            captivate and inspire.

        <h2>Project One</h2>
        <p>Wordle dupe. The standout for me here was the README file, I had way too much fun with it. Felt like it was
            important to showcase my personality with my first project, and I didn't really get to with my code. So my
            README it was!</p>
