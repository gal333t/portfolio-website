            <p>Welcome to my coding project showcase! My name is Galit, and for the last five years, I have been
                immersed in
                the fascinating world of television scheduling. With a strong background in administrative work,
                I've gained valuable experience and honed my organizational skills in this fast-paced industry. However,
                my
                journey has taken an exciting turn as I've delved into the captivating realm of coding.</p>
            <p>Driven by a desire for more engaging and dynamic work, I've eagerly embraced the world of programming.
                Equipped with a diverse skill set that includes <em>Javascript, HTML, CSS, ExpressJS, NodeJs, Postgres,
                    and
                    MongoDB</em>, I've honed my abilities to bring my ideas to life through code. With each project, I
                strive to
                combine my past experiences in television with my newfound coding skills, creating innovative solutions
                that
                captivate and inspire.

                <h2>Project One</h2>
                <p>Wordle dupe. The standout for me here was the README file, I had way too much fun with it. Felt like
                    it
                    was
                    important to showcase my personality with my first project, and I didn't really get to with my code.
                    So
                    my
                    README it was!</p>

                <h2>Project Two</h2>
                <p>For this project, I took advantage of the due date being the day before Mother's Day. My website used
                    a
                    database to store messages from me and my siblings and then displayed onto the page nicely for my
                    mother.</p>

                <p>We haven't got this project yet... Going to be APIS and other fun stuff with MongoDB, Express.js and
                    more
                    js.</p>

                <h2>API Homework</h2>
                <p>This is a wildcard, but I really loved this homework that I did in collaboration with my classmate

                <br />Been vegan since January 1st 2017, basically the only time a new years resolution has ever stuck.
                If you ever want some vegan recommendations, some good grocery finds, happy to share!
                <br />Love binge watching Law and Order - have done a watch through of every episode twice now. All spin

                but UK...
                <br />I've been learning Yiddish on Duolingo for over 400 days now. I should add a counter that updates
                on
                the
                daily to show off my streak, maybe one day.
