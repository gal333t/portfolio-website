        <p>Welcome to my coding project showcase! My name is Galit, and for the last five years, I have been immersed in
            the fascinating world of television scheduling. With a strong background in administrative work,
            I've gained valuable experience and honed my organizational skills in this fast-paced industry. However, my
            journey has taken an exciting turn as I've delved into the captivating realm of coding.</p>
        <p>Driven by a desire for more engaging and dynamic work, I've eagerly embraced the world of programming.
            Equipped with a diverse skill set that includes <em>Javascript, HTML, CSS, ExpressJS, NodeJs, Postgres, and
                MongoDB</em>, I've honed my abilities to bring my ideas to life through code. With each project, I
            strive to
            combine my past experiences in television with my newfound coding skills, creating innovative solutions that
            captivate and inspire.

            <h2>Project One</h2>
            <p>Wordle dupe. The standout for me here was the README file, I had way too much fun with it. Felt like it
                was
                important to showcase my personality with my first project, and I didn't really get to with my code. So
                my
                README it was!</p>

        <div class="project-block bg-secondary text-white">
            <h2>Project Two</h2>
            <p>For this project, I took advantage of the due date being the day before Mother's Day. My website used a
                database to store messages from me and my siblings and then displayed onto the page nicely for my
                mother.</p>

        <div class="project-block bg-secondary text-white">
            <h2>Project Three</h2>
            <p>We haven't got this project yet... Going to be APIS and other fun stuff with MongoDB, Express.js and more
                js.</p>

        <div class="project-block bg-secondary text-white">
            <h2>Project Four</h2>
            <p>This is going to be something made with react, but what? I couldn't tell ya.</p>

        <div class="project-block bg-secondary text-white">
            <h2>API Homework</h2>
            <p>This is a wildcard, but I really loved this homework that I did in collaboration with my classmate</p>
