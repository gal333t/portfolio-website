            <h3>Welcome to my coding project showcase!</h3>
            <p> My name is Galit, and for the last five years, I have been
                immersed in
                the fascinating world of television scheduling. With a strong background in administrative type work,
                I've gained valuable experience and honed my organisational skills in this fast-paced industry. However,
                my
                journey has taken an exciting turn as I've delved into the captivating realm of coding.</p>
            <p>Driven by a desire for more engaging and dynamic work, I've eagerly embraced the world of programming.
                Equipped with a diverse skill set that includes <em>Javascript, HTML, CSS, Express.js, NodeJs, Postgres,
                    and
                    MongoDB</em>, I've honed my abilities to bring my ideas to life through code. As my course slowly
                comes to an end now, I am hoping to get some more of my own personal projects in here. Does this website
                count as one? I have been experimenting with Bootstrap for this website, trying to teach myself
                something new as CSS can be quite daunting. How did I do?

                <h3>Project One</h3>
                <h4>Word Galactica.</h4>
                <p>As someone who plays Worlde every day, this was such a fun first project! We got to use our newly
                    developed skills in HTML, Javascript & CSS to create our own version or dupe of Wordle. It was
                    really daunting as the first project, but since handing it in I've had some fun going back and
                    trying to fix a few things up. Currently the only bug I am stuck with is to do with duplicate
                    letters, something I
                    <strong>will</strong> come back and fix. Unlike Wordle, you can refresh and play as
                    many times as you'd like.

                <h3>Project Two</h3>
                <p>Our second unit was focused on Python, Flask and Postgres. The timing of this project gave me the
                    idea to create a website that would serve as a card for Mother's Day. I had a table of users, which
                    included my siblings and myself that allowed users to write/edit/delete messages for our mum. When
                    you were done, you could view whatever you had written but only my mum could go in and see
                    everyone's messages together. My mum loved it so much, a pity Render only stores it for 6 months.
                    Thankfully took some screenshots for her, and I will try hosting on other websites in the future to
                    bring it back to life.</p>

                <h3>Project Three</h3>
                <p>Unit 3 is currently ongoing and we have just gotten our projects yesterday as of me writing this!
                    We've been delving into the world of backend Javascript, and getting used to using Express.js &
                    MongoDB with SPAs (Single Page Applications) and all the fun of APIs. Our project will also
                    have some AI integration which I am very excited to learn about! I will update with what the project
                    is about, as well as links to our GitHub and project itself when the time comes. This is first group
                    project, and I am working with the dream team so I can't wait to see what we end up with.

                <h3>API Homework</h3>
                <p>This is a wildcard, but I really loved this homework that I did in collaboration with a classmate. We
                    used Javascript and APIs to create a Ron Swanson Quote Generator. Their CSS skills really took it to
                    the next level, such a fun website to use anytime you'd like a handy Ron Swanson quote! Like now?
                </p>

            <ul>
                <li>I loooove dumplings and noodles, biang biang noods *chefs kiss* and some eggplant dumplings? Say no
                    more!
                </li>
                <li>Been vegan since January 1st 2017, basically the only time a new years resolution has ever stuck.
                    If you ever want some vegan recommendations, some good grocery finds, happy to share!
                </li>
                <li>Love binge watching Law and Order - have done a watch through of every episode twice now. All spin
                    offs
                    but UK... SVU will always be my favourite. Stabler forever.
                </li>
                <li>I am a diehard NRL fan. My team are the Roosters, but I am a bit of a Broncos fan too. I love the
                    rugby league community & how it brings people together. On game day you'll catch me in head to toe
                    gear,
                    with some red & blue makeup and nails to match. </li>
                <li>I've been learning Yiddish on Duolingo for over 400 days now. I should add a counter that updates
                    on the daily to show off my streak, maybe one day.
                </li>
                <li>I'm really passionate about recycling and one of my favourite things to do when I had weekends, was
                    to sort out recylcing through <a class="link" href="https://banish.com.au/pages/recycling-program"

                <li>Unlike a lot of coders it seems, I'm not much of a gamer. But I do love playing The Sims 4.</li>
