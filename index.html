            <h3>Welcome to my coding project showcase!</h3>
            <p> My name is Galit, and for the last five years, I have been
                immersed in
                the fascinating world of television scheduling. With a strong background in administrative type work,
                I've gained valuable experience and honed my organisational skills in this fast-paced industry. However,
                my
                journey has taken an exciting turn as I've delved into the captivating realm of coding.</p>
            <p>Driven by a desire for more engaging and dynamic work, I've eagerly embraced the world of programming.
                Equipped with a diverse skill set that includes <em>Javascript, HTML, CSS, Express.js, NodeJs, Postgres,
                    and
                    MongoDB</em>, I've honed my abilities to bring my ideas to life through code. As my course slowly
                comes to an end now, I am hoping to get some more of my own personal projects in here. Does this website
                count as one?

                <h3>Project One</h3>
                <h4>Word Galactica.</h4>
                <p>As someone who plays Worlde every day, this was such a fun first project! We got to use our newly
                    developed skills in HTML, Javascript & CSS to create a dupe of Wordle. It was really daunting as the
                    first project, but since handing it in I've had some fun going back and trying to fix a few things
                    up. Currently the only bug I am stuck with is to do with duplicate letters, something I
                    <strong>will</strong> come back and fix with objects.

                <h3>Project Two</h3>
                <p>Our second unit was focused on Python, Flask and Postgres. The timing of this project gave me the
                    idea to create a website that would serve as a card for Mother's Day. I had a table of users, which
                    included my siblings and myself that allowed users to write/edit/delete messages for our mum. When
                    you were done, you could view whatever you had written but only my mum could go in and see
                    everyone's messages together. My mum loved it so much, a pity Render only stored it for 6 months.
                    Thankfully took some screenshots for her, and I will try hosting on other websites in the future to
                    bring it back to life.</p>

                <h3>Project Three</h3>
                <p>Unit 3 is currently ongoing and we have just gotten our projects yesterday as of me writing this!
                    We've been delving into the world of backend Javascript, and getting used to using Express.js &
                    MongoDB with SPAs (Single Page Applications) and all the fun of APIs. Our project will also
                    have some AI integration which I am very excited to learn about! I will update with what the project
                    is about, as well as links to our GitHub and project itself when the time comes. This is first group
                    project, and I am working with the dream team so I can't wait to see what we end up with.

                <h3>API Homework</h3>
                <p>This is a wildcard, but I really loved this homework that I did in collaboration with my classmate
                    (who for the time being I won't name while they haven't told their employer). We used Javascript and
                    APIs to create a Ron Swanson Quote Generator. Their CSS skills
                    really took it to the next level, such a fun website to use anytime you'd like a handy Ron Swanson
                    quote! Like now?
