# Portfolio Website

I've finally gotten around to making a portfolio website. Simply using HTML & CSS (with Bootstrap!).

First "launch" is missing a few things.

### What I want to add:

- A Navbar with my LinkedIn and GitHub attached
- Work out how to reposition the buttons to the bottom right of the div it sits in
- Maybe change the colour scheme, unsure
- Add some flair, some images perhaps?
