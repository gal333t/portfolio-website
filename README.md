# Portfolio Website

I've finally gotten around to making a portfolio website. Simply using HTML & CSS (with Bootstrap!).

First "launch" is missing a few things.

### What I want to add:

- Work out how to reposition the buttons to the bottom right of the div it sits in so they're all aligned
- Maybe change the colour scheme, unsure
- Add some flair, some images perhaps?
- Something that uses JS for a bit of practice

## Version 2.0

Please welcome Backend to the portfolio website! Even though no one ever saw the original frontend only version, I felt like we deserved a big update (hence the 2.0) for this. I've now added backend with a MongoDB database & axios to connect everything and create a SPA (single page application). Pretty good stuff I know. I wasn't going to stress about doing this, but it means I can dynamically add new projects without having to go into the code and change anything. Hopefully works the way I intend in the future and makes it a lot more streamlined for myself. More updates to come.
