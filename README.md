# Portfolio Website

[link to the website](https://portfolio-bl5z.onrender.com)

I've finally gotten around to making a portfolio website! At first I left it as a simple HTML page and took the opportunity to learn Bootstrap for my CSS, but in the middle of Project 3 I decided to go full out Javascript. Updates will be noted below in relevant sections, outlining each stage a bit more.

As it's deployed on Render, please be patient as it can take a little while to load.

## Version 1.0

NO LONGER IN USE.

A basic webpage running off one HTML file, showcasing some newly learnt styling through Bootstrap. Basic, boring but functional. Displays all the projects I've worked on/are in progress onto the page with some info about me.

## Version 2.0

Please welcome Backend to the portfolio website! Even though no one ever saw the original frontend only version, I felt like we deserved a big update (hence the 2.0) for this. I've now added backend with Javascript, a MongoDB database & axios to connect everything and create a SPA (single page application). Pretty good stuff I know. I wasn't going to stress about doing this, but I want this portfolio website to really showcase my abilities, and basic HTML doesn't really do that the way I want. It'll also make adding more projects to the page easier, once a system has been established for only me to access and add to it. For now, new projects will be hardcoded and added via server.js.

### Updated Version 2.1

And here we go, the Blog has begun! More to come, stay tuned. Going to be writing about my experience in the course & learning all these new skills. Updated colours, addded a little variety in there to give it something less bland. But I did love the greyish tones, maybe one day I'll dial it back a bit again.

### Updated Version 2.2

This was super fun. I am really enjoying these little updates every Sunday. Now when you click on Blog in the navigation bar, you can see the titles of each post and click through to read the blog itself! Very cool little addition to clean up the page a bit. I need to finish off a few more posts to test how it looks and finish making styling changes instead of just saying I have in every commit.

### What I want to add:

- While in a blog heavy mood atm, I am thinking of adding a time stamp or some acknowledgment on the first rendered page with the headings where it shows the date. I will be adding this for my Sunday Musings every week, but could be cool to track them all. That page just needs a little something more.
- My CV, not sure the best way to do this to TBD for now if/how I'll deploy this info
- A page showcasing some screenshots of my work (both when they were in development and current)
- Mobile responsiveness, specifically for the navbar (maybe turning it into a Bootstrap collapsible navbar? )
- Work on making it an accessible webpage that works well with a screen reader
