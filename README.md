# Portfolio Website

[link to the website](https://portfolio-bl5z.onrender.com)

I've finally gotten around to making a portfolio website! At first I left it as a simple HTML page and took the opportunity to learn Bootstrap for my CSS, but in the middle of Project 3 I decided to go full out Javascript. Updates will be noted below in relevant sections, outlining each stage a bit more.

## Version 1.0

NO LONGER IN USE.

A basic webpage running off one HTML file, showcasing some newly learnt styling through Bootstrap. Basic, boring but functional. Displays all the projects I've worked on/are in progress onto the page with some info about me.

## Version 2.0

Please welcome Backend to the portfolio website! Even though no one ever saw the original frontend only version, I felt like we deserved a big update (hence the 2.0) for this. I've now added backend with Javascript, a MongoDB database & axios to connect everything and create a SPA (single page application). Pretty good stuff I know. I wasn't going to stress about doing this, but I want this portfolio website to really showcase my abilities, and basic HTML doesn't really do that the way I want. It'll also make adding more projects to the page easier, once a system has been established for only me to access and add to it. For now, new projects will be hardcoded and added via server.js.

### What I want to add:

- Mobile responsiveness, specifically for the navbar (maybe turning it into a Bootstrap collapsible navbar? )
- Maybe change the colour scheme, I love dark mode so the darkness appeals to me but it might need a little colour to it
- Add some flair, some images perhaps? A link that showcases some screenshots of my projects in all different stages of development
- An admin login page only I can access and add more project entries too. Not sure the best way to do this and not have it visible to everyone.. One of the few downsides to a SPA (in my opinion). Open to suggestions.
