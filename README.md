# Portfolio Website

[link to the website](https://portfolio-bl5z.onrender.com)

I've finally gotten around to making a portfolio website! At first I left it as a simple HTML page and took the opportunity to learn Bootstrap for my CSS, but in the middle of Project 3 I decided to go full out Javascript. Updates will be noted below in relevant sections, outlining each stage a bit more.

As it's deployed on Render, please be patient as it can take a little while to load.

## Version 1.0

NO LONGER IN USE.

A basic webpage running off one HTML file, showcasing some newly learnt styling through Bootstrap. Basic, boring but functional. Displays all the projects I've worked on/are in progress onto the page with some info about me.

## Version 2.0

Please welcome Backend to the portfolio website! Even though no one ever saw the original frontend only version, I felt like we deserved a big update (hence the 2.0) for this. I've now added backend with Javascript, a MongoDB database & axios to connect everything and create a SPA (single page application). Pretty good stuff I know. I wasn't going to stress about doing this, but I want this portfolio website to really showcase my abilities, and basic HTML doesn't really do that the way I want. It'll also make adding more projects to the page easier, once a system has been established for only me to access and add to it. For now, new projects will be hardcoded and added via server.js.

### Updated Version 2.1

And here we go, the Blog has begun! More to come, stay tuned. Going to be writing about my experience in the course & learning all these new skills. Updated colours, addded a little variety in there to give it something less bland. But I did love the greyish tones, maybe one day I'll dial it back a bit again.

### What I want to add:

- My CV, not sure the best way to do this to TBD for now if/how I'll deploy this info
- Adjust the colour scheme, I love dark mode so the darkness appeals to me but it needs a little colour to it
- A page showcasing some screenshots of my work (both when they were in development and current)
- Mobile responsiveness, specifically for the navbar (maybe turning it into a Bootstrap collapsible navbar? )
